# **Hybrid Images**

A **hybrid image** is an image that is perceived in one of two different ways, depending on viewing distance, based on the way humans process visual input. <br />
Hybrid images combine the low spatial frequencies of one picture with the high spatial frequencies of another picture, producing an image with an interpretation that changes with viewing distance.<br /><br />
